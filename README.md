# pipe-grep

`pipe-grep` is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides grep-like filtering functionality. It allows you to filter lines in the active editor based on a regular expression (regex) pattern, similar to how you would use `| grep` on the command line.

## Commands

- `pipe-grep: Filter lines (in place)` - Filters the current document in-place, removing lines that don't match the regex pattern
- `pipe-grep: Filter lines (new document)` - Creates a new document containing only the lines that match the regex pattern
